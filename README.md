# Newton's Method
An implementation of Newton's Method in C

# Description

This project uses Newton's Method for finding the square root of a number.  See more [here](https://math.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Calculus/Map%3A_Calculus__Early_Transcendentals_(Stewart)/04%3A_Applications_of_Differentiation/4.08%3A_Newton%27s_Method).

## Usage

The program will prompt you to enter:
1. The number for which you want to calculate the square root.
2. The epsilon value (accuracy level).

The program will display an approximation of the square root for each iteration until it reaches a value within the provided range.
